# 🔍 Email/SMS Scam Detector — OIBSIP Data Science Internship Task 2

This project is part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.  
The objective is to build a **Machine Learning model** that can classify messages as **scam (spam)** or **legitimate (ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📘 Objective
To create a system that can automatically detect fraudulent or spam messages and protect users from scams.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Collection** — used a public dataset of labeled SMS/email messages.  
2. **Data Cleaning** — removed punctuation, stopwords, and converted text to lowercase.  
3. **Text Preprocessing** — tokenized words and applied stemming/lemmatization.  
4. **Feature Extraction** — used TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numeric features.  
5. **Model Building** — trained models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.  
6. **Model Evaluation** — compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Results
- The **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model achieved the highest accuracy.  
- Successfully classifies scam/spam messages with strong performance metrics.  
- Visualized confusion matrix and word frequency distributions for insights.
